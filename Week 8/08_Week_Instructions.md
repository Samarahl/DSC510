# DSC510 - Week 8
## Collaborating via GitHub

In the past 7 weeks, you have done a remarkable amount of work. At this point, some of us are ready to quit, some of us will want to set our computers on fire, and others will want to learn more. 

If you fall into any of these categories, that's awesome. If you do not, that's ok too! 

Remember that programming - from an historical perspective - is very, very new. We don't fully understand how to teach it, let alone how it works. In the present, there are very few people in the world who can understand how a piece of software works completely. We simply write too much and too many people have a hand in making it work. Even our cars are too complex to understand from a computational perspective. 

And this is the world you're heading in to. You do not need to know how everything works. you do not need to know every answer.

* No one knows every answer.
* No one knows how anything works let alone everything.

And so we got that out of the way.

This week, we're taking a little break. Not a complete break but we are going to take a brief breather and maybe a short walk. We don't have to sprint all the time.

To do that, we will begin to think about a few things: 

* Github
* Markdown
* Other ways to _do_ Python. 

This week specifically, we'll be taking a look at Github.

#### What is Github?

Have you heard of Dropbox? Google Drive? The Cloud? Github is _sort of_ these things. 

From github itself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E 

In plain english: it is a way to make sure the coding stuff you're working on is backed up and accessible for people who might also be working with you. It has version control and very structured collaborative features. For example, if a ton of people make changes to something inside your folder then you or those you designate as capable of making changes can go through each suggested change and merge them all.

#### Getting started with Github

First things first, let's take a bit of a tour of everything related to Github: 

- https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
- This tutorial is also interesting. It will help to introduce you to something else we'll be talking about _introducing you to other ways to do python._
- https://try.github.io/ is good to see _how_ things work.

This tutorial will usually have the most introductory aspects to Github. It is a useful refresher if it's been a while. It's also a useful space to learn those things that mark every aspect of learning how to _be_ in a technical space: 

* vocabulary
* concepts

Learning how to speak like someone who does technical stuff is just as important (for your career) as learning how things work. 

Now that you've done that, think about setting up PyCharm for Github. 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2856pbucPAE this tutorial will help you get started. I will also be recording a video for you.

Now, there's something to think about with this. You don't _have_ to understand this product from beginning to end. All you need to do are two specific things right now: 

1. Get files into the repository you want.
2. Download files from that repository. 

And you can do that using something like: 

1. Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/ 
2. SourceTree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ 

These two products work a lot like Dropbox or Google Drive. They are ways for you to grab (pull) or send (push) to a folder that exists on a computer hard drive that is replicated and redundant in many different ways. 

So it's replicated, redundant, and this means your data won't disappear. However, this also doesn't mean you can't make mistakes and do something to your data. You can always overwrite, not save, or screw up your data. 

* and you will. Don't worry, you'll make a ton of mistakes!
* Make them. Get used to them.

### So what am I being asked to do this week?

This week, we're going to help you make some mistakes and take a few new steps into a larger world. This step is important and it's so amazing to see it unfold. 

You might not like GitHub at first. This is also ok. But getting forced to do something with this very important product is not only useful, but necessary. 

This week you're going to be uploading your MSDS project in progress. We'll be doing this in two steps: 

#### By Thursday

1. Tell your instructor your Github Username.
2. Clone the repository that you are invited to. 
3. Add your current MSDS project using the filename structure `LAST_NAME_MSDS510` (This will be a folder within which you will place your content).
4. And commit those changes to the repository and push them to it.

#### By Sunday

1. Look at other people's work. Some of them will need help. 
2. Make 3 _substantive_ suggestions to the code of others.

What suggestions you make will be dependent on you. If the code you're looking at isn't working for you, can you fix it? Can you find a `more simplistic` way of doing things to existing code? 

More often than not, many of the changes you make might just be adding comments to the code of others. We are all terrible at commenting code. Help us out!

What does `substantive` mean here? 
As with your Interest / Discussion posts, `substantive` means that you've provided substance either for the person who originally wrote the code _or_ the people who might see the code later. 

The way we'll grade this content is to look at see that you've made at least a few changes and _then_ look at the substance of those changes. Did you offer something helpful? Did you add language to help future coders make sense of what they're looking at? Substance - in this case - is essentially a measure of how helpful you've been.
